# MirrorLog

### Small logging library intended for use in <a href=https://github.com/tremorris1999/Mirror>Mirror</a>.
---
This library has not seen any use *(that I'm aware of)* outside my project Mirror. Even then, implementation in of MirrorLog in Mirror is a **slow** process ~~because I'm lazy~~.

Tested platforms:
   - Windows 10 (x64)
